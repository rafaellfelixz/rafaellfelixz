# Welcome!

I'm Rafael (or **Void**). I'm currently working on **open-source (NC) projects**, aiming to make the resources freely available for everyone to use, as long as they provide proper credit.

I'm a **Brazilian student** who's truly passionate about programming. I started this journey in **August 2024**. Initially, I really disliked everything related to programming, but after some challenging times and unexpected events and changes, I began to genuinely **appreciate and enjoy** it.

## Current Work

As I mentioned, I am developing a **web notebook** to compile all the techniques and interesting concepts I've learned from the beginning. You can check it out **[here](https://github.com/rafaellfelixz/KnwCtr.git)**.
