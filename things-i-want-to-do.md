# Random Ideas
Well. Since I'm really curious how compilers work and co-work with tons of another languages and kinda immediately generate bytecode, I'll consider structing a project using Lua JIT and CPP. 
Basically it'll generate bytecode for a specific lang I'll name it Lure and it'll be a experiment purpose project. 
## I will need 

* Lua JIT (Just-In-Time)
  I lowkey dont know why but I always wanted to work with Lua JIT.
* C++ (CPP)
  So I can generate binaries easily.
